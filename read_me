## Introduction

In React, **state** represents data that is managed within a component, while **props** (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components. This project includes basic examples of how to use **state** with the `useState` hook and how to pass **props** between components.

## Features

- Demonstrates the use of **state** to handle dynamic data in components.
- Illustrates the use of **props** to pass data from parent to child components.
- Includes basic event handling (e.g., button clicks to update the state).

function App() {
  const [userLoggedIn, setUserLoggedIn] = useState(true);

  function handleLoginToggle() {
    setUserLoggedIn(!userLoggedIn);
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>User is {userLoggedIn ? "Logged In" : "Logged Out"}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleLoginToggle}>Toggle Login State</button>
      <DisplayUser userName="John Doe" />
    </div>
  );
}

function DisplayUser(props) {
